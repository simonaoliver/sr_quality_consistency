| Consistency (surface reflectance) | Two or more quantities are consistent if they are equal in magnitude, or within a certain range of a reference value that is deemed to be the true value of the measure that the quantities represent, or each of the quantities can be converted into one another through a consistent process. When two or more surface reflectance quantities over the same target area derived from observations made by different sensors, are equal in magnitude or within a certain range of the true surface reflectance over the same target area (the reference surface reflectance or known standard). | CEOS SR Equivalence, Quality and Consistency discussion group  |
| Homogeniszation | Unlike harmonisation, homogenisation is where all satellites are forced to look the same such that when looking at the same location at the same time they would (in theory) give the same signal. In reality the signals from different sensors would be different and homogenisation is adding in corrective terms to each satellite to make them look the same. It is likely that these corrective terms will not be 100% effective and that the process of homogenisation will add in scene dependent errors to the uncertainty budget which may be difficult to assess. | [Glossary \- Fiduceo (reading.ac.uk)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/fiduceo/glossary/) |
| Harmoniszation | A harmonised satellite series is one where all the calibrations of the sensors have been done consistently relative to reference datasets which can be traced back to known reference sources, in an ideal case back to SI. Each sensor is calibrated to the reference in a way that maintains the characteristics of that individual sensor such that the calibration radiances represent the unique nature of each sensor. This means that two sensors which have been harmonised may see different signals when looking at the same location at the same time, the difference being related to known differences in the responses of each sensor such as differences in the sensors spectral response functions etc. | [Glossary \- Fiduceo (reading.ac.uk)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/fiduceo/glossary/) |
| Collection | The ensemble of some products or auxiliary data  having a common focus or theme or purpose (e.g.  collection of land photos) | [https://ceos.org/document\_management/Working\_Groups/WGISS/Interest\_Groups/Data\_Stewardship/White\_Papers/EO-DataStewardshipGlossary.pdf](https://ceos.org/document_management/Working_Groups/WGISS/Interest_Groups/Data_Stewardship/White_Papers/EO-DataStewardshipGlossary.pdf)  |
| Like bands | Spectral bands (from different sensors) with similar characteristics (FWHM, band center wavelength) | This document |
| Uncertainty(of measurement) | Parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that  could reasonably be attributed to the measurand | [Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement \- JCGM 100:2008 (GUM 1995 with minor corrections \- Evaluation of measurement data](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/2071204/JCGM_100_2008_E.pdf/cb0ef43f-baa5-11cf-3f85-4dcd86f77bd6) |
| Radiometric normalization | Radiometric normalisation is a process which attempts to remove some of the variance seen in EO data to create values that are independent of view angle or atmospheric state or observing time etc. to give a uniform measure of a given variable across an image. It can be considered as a method to give what would have been observed by the same instrument under viewing identical conditions. | [Glossary \- Fiduceo (reading.ac.uk)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/fiduceo/glossary/) |
